## Background:
Have you ever felt happy, sad, annoyed, excited, anxious, etc. Did you know creating art heals pain? 
All the Feels is a website that creates a place where adolescents can share their drawings, sketches, doodles. Community is one of the most important emotional resources someone can have. Connect with your peers by adding comments and support to each other’s posts in an expressive online space where you can lift each other up”
